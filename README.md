[My blog post about participation]()

## The Journal of Adventures  

LEVEL 1
======= 

Success! You've managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda's evil organization, and finally earned yourself an entry-level position as a Minion on her space station. From here, you just might be able to subvert her plans to use the LAMBCHOP doomsday device to destroy Bunny Planet. Problem is, Minions are the lowest of the low in the Lambda hierarchy. Better buck up and get working, or you'll never make it to the top...

[Task 1](https://github.com/nkapliev/google-foo.bar/blob/master/1_solar_doomsday.py)

Next time Bunny HQ needs someone to infiltrate a space station to rescue prisoners, you're going to tell them to make sure 'stay up for 48 hours straight scrubbing toilets' is part of the job description. It's only fair to warn people, after all.

LEVEL 2
======= 

You survived a week in Commander Lambda's organization, and you even managed to get yourself promoted. Hooray! Henchmen still don't have the kind of security access you'll need to take down Commander Lambda, though, so you'd better keep working. Chop chop!

[Task 2.1](https://github.com/nkapliev/google-foo.bar/blob/master/2.1_bunny_prisoner_locating.py)

The perks are definitely better as a Henchman than as a Minion. You're even allowed to sleep lying down!

[Task 2.2](https://github.com/nkapliev/google-foo.bar/blob/master/2.2_fuel_injection_perfection.py)

The latest gossip in the henchman breakroom is that "LAMBCHOP" stands for "Lambda's Anti-Matter Biofuel Collision Hadron Oxidating Potentiator". You're pretty sure it runs on diesel, not biofuel, but you can at least give the commander credit for trying.

LEVEL 3
======= 

Awesome! Commander Lambda was so impressed by your efforts that she's made you her personal assistant. You'll be helping her directly with her work, which means you'll have access to all of her files-including the ones on the LAMBCHOP doomsday device. This is the chance you've been waiting for. Can you use your new access to finally topple Commander Lambda's evil empire?

[Task 3.1](https://github.com/nkapliev/google-foo.bar/blob/master/3.1_gearing_up_for_destruction.py)

Commander Lambda has six suits, three dress uniforms, four casual outfits, and one Dress-Uniform-For-Important-Speeches-Only. You know this because you've already had to take all of them to the dry cleaner's. Twice!

[Task 3.2](https://github.com/nkapliev/google-foo.bar/blob/master/3.2_bomb_baby.py)

One of these days you're going to manage to glimpse Commander Lambda's password over her shoulder. But she's very careful about security, and you haven't managed it yet...

[Task 3.3](https://github.com/nkapliev/google-foo.bar/blob/master/3.3_queue_to_do.py)

Who the heck puts clover and coffee creamer in their tea? Commander Lambda, apparently. When you signed up to infiltrate her organization, you didn't think you'd get such an up-close and personal look at her more...unusual tastes.

LEVEL 4
======= 

Excellent! You've destroyed Commander Lambda's doomsday device and saved Bunny Planet! But there's one small problem: the LAMBCHOP was a wool-y important part of her space station, and when you blew it up, you triggered a chain reaction that's tearing the station apart. Can you rescue the imprisoned bunnies and escape before the entire thing explodes?

[Task 4.1](https://github.com/nkapliev/google-foo.bar/blob/master/4.1_bringing_a_gun_to_a_guard_fight.py)

'Destroy a doomsday device,' they said. 'Rescue prisoners,' they said. 'Be a hero,' they said. They didn't mention anything about having to escape through a trash compactor that could turn on at any time. Doesn't anyone in Bunny HQ watch movies?!

[Task 4.2](https://github.com/nkapliev/google-foo.bar/blob/master/4.2_escape_pods.py)

This was supposed to be an infiltration-and-rescue mission, not a repeat of the Great Cowland Station fiasco! You didn't think rescuing bunnies would involve this much running.

LEVEL 5
======= 

Oh no! You escaped Commander Lambda's exploding space station - but so did she, and she's definitely not happy with you. She's chasing you in her heavily-armed starfighter, while you and your bunny refugees are stuck in these lumbering escape pods. It'll take all your wits and cleverness to escape such a hare-y situation, so you'd better hop to it!

[Task 5](https://github.com/nkapliev/google-foo.bar/blob/master/5_dodge_the_lasers.py)

Huzzah! The famous pilots Luke Skybunny and Jyn Erbun managed to hijack a pair of Commander Lambda's starfighters and are laying down cover fire for the bunnies' escape pods. You give them a wing salute on your way past.

EPILOGUE
======== 

With one last roar of the escape pod's engines, you and your bunny companions jump to lightspeed. Congratulations! You've destroyed the LAMBCHOP, rescued the bunnies, gotten Commander Lambda off your tail, and saved the galaxy. Time for a little rest and relaxation back on Bunny Planet. Pat yourself on the back - you've earned it!
